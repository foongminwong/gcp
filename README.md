1. [Introduction to AI and Machine Learning on Google Cloud](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/introduction-ai-machine-learning-google-cloud/table-of-contents)

a. Introduction
- AI Foundations
    - Cloud essentials e.g., compute, storage, network, and data tools such as data piplines & analytics
- AI Development
    - Predictive AI & Generative AI: Different options to build a machine learning project, including out‑of‑the‑box solutions, low code or no code, and DIY
- AI Development Workflow
    - Workflow to train & serve a ML model using Vertex AI (Google CLoud's AI Development Platform)
- Generative AI
    - How generative AI empowers the AI development and AI solutions layer (Vertical & horizontal solutions).

b. AI Foundations
- Why AI?
    - Input -> Process -> Output
    - Multimodal -> Prediction & Generation -> Insights & Visualization
    - Multimodal Input:
        Various forms of data such as text, customer reviews, images, coffee and dessert pictures, and videos, real‑time street view
    - Prediction & generation:
        - Powered by (1) data analytics like customer segment analysis, (2) predictive AI like sales forecasting, route design, and (3) generative AI like marketing campaign automation, customer responses.
    - Insights & Visual Output:
        -  Insights & reports are presented visually, empowering businesses to make real‑time, data‑driven decisions and optimize their operations.
    - Tools:
        - Gemini multimodal: data Acquisition
        - BigQuery: Data Analytics
        - Vertex AI: ML Development
        Looker & google APIS: Data visualization & app creation
    - Architecture: 
        - Data acquisition -> AI/ analytics -> Visualization & activation
        - Data Ingestion (Data) -> Data Analytics (Data) -> Data Engineering (Data) -> Model Training (AI) -> Testing (AI) -> Deployment (AI)
        - Predictive AI: Predict trends & make classifications.
        - Generative AI: Generates content & perform tasks.

- AI/ ML on Google Cloud
    - History of Google data processing methods & contributions to AI advancements

- Google Cloud Infrastructure - TBD
